{"name":"Pentest-env","tagline":"Pentest environment (kali linux) deployer using vagrant and chef.","body":"# Pentest Environment Deployer\r\n\r\nThis repo provides an easy way to deploy a clean pentesting environment with Kali linux using vagrant and virtualbox.\r\n\r\n## Requirements\r\nI assume you are familiar with virtualbox and vagrant.\r\n- https://www.virtualbox.org/\r\n- http://www.vagrantup.com/\r\n\r\nLatest `pentest-env` release is tested with:\r\n- Virtualbox (5.0.14)\r\n- Vagrant (1.8.1)\r\n\r\n## Current box\r\n### Kali 2016.1\r\n- http://box.hackbbs.org/kali-2016.1.box\r\n\r\nSee the [wiki](https://github.com/Sliim/pentest-env/wiki/About-boxes) page about boxes for more details.\r\n\r\n## Getting started\r\nTo get started with `pentest-env`, clone this repository and run `vagrant up kali` inside the directory.\r\nThis will download and run the Kali instance.\r\n\r\nYou can customize, add targets, create new targets etc.. inside `pentest-env`\r\n\r\nFor more details, visit the [wiki](https://github.com/Sliim/pentest-env/wiki) page.\r\n\r\nIf you use `Chef`, this [chef-repo](https://github.com/Sliim/pentest-chef-repo) is for you!\r\n\r\n## About Security\r\nProvided boxes run the `sshd` service.\r\n\r\nSo if you plan to run the Kali linux with a Bridged interface, default setup can be dangerous!\r\n\r\n- `root` password of kali is `toor`.\r\n- SSH private key is not private! Anyone can use this [key](https://github.com/Sliim/pentest-env/blob/master/ssh-keys/pentest-env) to connect to your instance.\r\n- The Kali linux 1.0 box added a `vagrant` user with password `tnargav` and is in sudoers with no password required.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
